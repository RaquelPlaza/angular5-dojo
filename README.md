# angular5-dojo
A tutorial to get started with Angular 5 and explore its possibilities to put together front end applications

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you will need to have the following installed:

* node (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* npm (bundled with node - https://www.npmjs.com/)
* yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/) - yarn is recommended for anyone at Bath due to proxy issues with npm
* angular cli (https://cli.angular.io/)
* visual studio code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Angular command line interface (cli) is exactly what it says on the tin, a cli that will speed up the creation of multiple angular components. To install through command prompt type

```
npm install -g @angular/cli 
OR 
yarn global add @angular/cli
```

### Installing

Create a new project with the Angular cli, navigate to the project folder and start the server

```
ng new angular5-dojo --skip-install (create all the files, don't download the modules yet)*
cd angular5-dojo
npm install OR yarn (downloads the required modules)
ng serve OR yarn start
```

You can see the newly create site on http://localhost:4200/

*You may be wondering why we used the --skip-install flag? Simply put, if you've made a typo or made a mistake in your default configuration you've just downloaded a chunk of files for nothing. By using skip-install you can check what is created before downloading all the required modules. The angular cli has a lot of flags to speed up the creation of projects that you can explore at a later date but its good practise to check what is created from the start.   

### Visual Studio Code

The argument is out there on the best development IDE but we shall use Visual Studio Code, you should have grabbed a copy as part of the prerequisites. Open it up and drag you project folder in. Your project should now be open and to make your life easier you can go to view > integrated terminal to have a cmd terminal open within your environment. Nice!

### Third party components (Bootstrap 4)

If you've not used bootstrap before you're in for a treat! Bootstrap is a nice library of dynamic components and layout tools that are implemented through html classes. It's not the focal point of this tutorial but we will be using it so let’s install it.

Firstly let’s use npm/yarn to grab the files. There are major differences between 3 and 4 so make sure you have version 4.

```
npm install bootstrap
OR
yarn add bootstrap@4
```

Following that command you will find a reference to bootstrap in the projects package.json file under "dependencies". You will also find the Bootstrap files in the node_modules folder. Unfortunately bootstrap does another reference to get off the ground. In the .angular-cli.json under scripts add in     

```
"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
```

Congrats bootstrap styling can now be applied across the project. Now styling is present lets enable bootstraps animations, unfortunalty Bootstrap relies on Jquery for them. Howbever we can get away with jquery-slim. Once again use npm or yarn to pull the packages.

```
npm install jquery-slim
OR
yarn add jquery-slim
```

You can follow the steps through again to see where files have been added but there are now a couple of references to add to .angular-cli.json again. Under scripts add the following.

```
"../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.slim.min.js",
"../node_modules/bootstrap/js/dist/util.js",
"../node_modules/bootstrap/js/dist/collapse.js"
```

Basic animations have now been added. For more information on bootstrap version 4 https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/
